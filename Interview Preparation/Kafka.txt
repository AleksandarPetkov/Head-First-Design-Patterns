1) What is kafka: Kafka is a distributed system consisting of servers and clients that communicate via a high-performance TCP network protocol
   Event-streaming points to two differnt types(Create/Process real time stream)
   * Creating real time stream (when kafka receive stream of data from third party app)
   * Process real time stream (when kafka is already received stream of data need to process it)
   Example: [Sending data server] --> [Kafka] --> [Our app]
   * What distributed mean: we can distrubute additional kafka service to regions and if one is down call other

2) Why do we need kafka: 
   Example: if postman come to the home and I'm not there the letter(data) will be lost
   To fix the issue I can add 'Letter box' which act as middleman between me and post man and the data is safe

   Example: I have two apps AP1 and AP2. AP1 wants to send data to AP2. But if AP2 is not available the data will be lost
   TO overcome this issue need to install something simular to the 'letter box' between this two apps. Some kind of messagind system (Rabbit MQ, Kafka, Redis, ect..)
   [AP1] --> [Kafka (messaging system)] --> [AP2]

   Example: If we have multiple services wich communicate with multiple other services. Challenges (Data format, Connection types)
   Instead of creating multiple connections use messaging system. All data is send to Kafka and depending which data is needed for
   the others services find it in kafka
   [ap1]  -->           <-- [ap3]
   [ap2]  -->  [Kafka]  <-- [ap4]
   [ap3]  -->           <-- [ap5]

3) How does it work (Basic): Publisher / Subscriber model
   [[Publisher]] --> (publish message/event/data) -->   [[Message broker (message will set here)]]  <-- (will go to the broker and ask for messages) <-- [[Subsciber]]

4) Kafka Architecture/Components:
   - Producer-Consumer: Produce source of data which publish the messages/events to the broker (Kafka). Then Kafka will store this messages and then Consumer will get them
   
   - Cluster: Group of services/computers which works for common purpose. Can have multiple kafka services single kafka Cluster.
     Cluster[ Kafka1, Kafka2, .. ] This is very useful when single Kafka broker is not able to handle to load, then other broker will care
   
  - Topic: Provide a way to organize and categorize the messages within the Kafka messaging system. If kafka have a lot large amount of data,
    we can create multiple topics to store different type of data. Producer will create concrete topic and Consumer will search for this concrete topic
 
  - Partition: Topics in Kafka are divided into Partitions, and each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records (messages)
    Break Topic into multipal parts and distribute thise parts into different machines
    Topic: [partition_1, partition_2, partition_3...]
   
  - Offset (Offset Number): Purpose of the Offset is to keep it track of which message have been already consumed by Consumer
  
  - Consumer Group: specify group of cosumers (multiple services)

  - Zookeeper: Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service that is often used alongside Apache Kafka to manage and coordinate distributed systems.
    While Apache Kafka itself can operate without ZooKeeper starting from Kafka 2.8.0 (as Kafka is moving towards removing its dependency on ZooKeeper),
    ZooKeeper has historically played a crucial role in Kafka's architecture.
