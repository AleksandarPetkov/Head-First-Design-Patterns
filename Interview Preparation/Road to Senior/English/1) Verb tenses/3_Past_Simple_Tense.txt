1) The Past Simple tense is used to talk about actions or events that happened in the PAST and are FINISHED.

🕒 Examples:
  I watched a movie yesterday.
  She visited Paris last year.

2) How to Form the Past Simple
   A) Regular Verbs Add -ed to the base verb.
    walk->walked, play->played, clean->cleaned

 Spelling Rules:
 If the verb ends in e, just add -d: love → loved
 If the verb ends in a consonant + 'y', change 'y' to 'i' and add -'ed': study → studied
 For most one-syllable verbs with a vowel + consonant, double the final consonant: stop → stopped

  B) Irregular Verbs. Irregular verbs don’t follow the -ed rule. You must memorize them.
  Example: go -> went, eat -> ate, have->had, be->was/were, take->took


3) NEGATIVE FORM
 🧠 Structure: Subject + didn’t + base verb (infinitive)
 ⚠️ Use the base form of the verb, not the past form!

✅ Correct	 ❌ Wrong
I didn’t eat.	 I didn’t ate. ❌
She didn’t go.	 She didn’t went. ❌

4) QUESTION FORM
 🧠 Structure: Did + subject + base verb + (object)?
 ⚠️ Always use the base verb after did.

 🗣 Examples: Did you watch the movie? Did she go to work yesterday? Did they have dinner with you? Did he call you last night?

Exercises:

 A) Did you watch the game last night? ❌
    ❗ You wrote: "Did you watched", but after did, we always use the base form, not the past form.
    ✅ Correct answer: Did you watch the game last night?

 B) Remember: after didn’t, always use the base verb, not the past form.
    ❌ He didn’t watched TV [Wrong]
    ✅ He didn’t watch TV.
