1) Present simple tense

1) We use the present simple when we talk about things in general. We use it to say that
something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general:
Jane works as a barista. Her shift begins at 7 a.m.
2) The present simple is formed with the bare infinitive form of the verb. We add -s in the
third person singular (he/she/it).

- Example: Agata hate.....[to hate] when her little brathers leave...[to leave] toys on the floor.

   "Her little brothers" is plural (more than one brother).
    The verb must agree with the plural subject.
    The correct plural form of the verb "to leave" in present tense is "leave" (no -s).

     Examples:
     He leaves his shoes at the door. (singular subject: "he")
     They leave their shoes at the door. (plural subject: "they")

     In your sentence:
     "Agata hates" → present simple (she = singular, so verb takes -s).
     "when her little brothers leave" → "brothers" = plural → verb does not take -s.

- Example: Noah washes ...[to wash] the dishesh and his wife ...[to cook] cooks dinner.
- Example [To be/have]: My mother family it is...[to be] quete big. She has.. [to have] 5 brothers
- Example: Don't, Doesn't 
  [I   / You / We / They]  ====> don’t
  [He / She / It]          ====> doesn’t

- Example: Do, Does
  [I / You / We / They] ===>	do	===>     They do their homework.
  [He / She / It]	===>   does     ===>	She does yoga every day.

      Questions:
      **** Do/Does + subject + base verb

      Subject + don’t / doesn’t + base verb
