********   What Is SSH?
  SSH uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable communication.
  SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to another computer (usually a server) over the internet or a local network.
  SSH lets you remotely control another machine, just like you're sitting in front of it.

 ðŸ”§ What You Can Do With SSH:
 Run commands on a remote server
 Start/stop applications
 Transfer files (using tools like scp or sftp)
 Deploy code
 Monitor system resources
 Set up port forwarding or tunnels

 ðŸ”’ Why SSH Is Secure:
 SSH encrypts all communication between your local machine and the remote machine, protecting against:
 Eavesdropping (man-in-the-middle attacks), Password theft

 ðŸ“¦ SSH Example: ssh alice@192.168.1.10
  ssh â€” the command
  alice â€” the user you're logging in as
  192.168.1.10 â€” the IP address of the remote machine

 You'll be prompted for a password, or it will use a secure SSH key pair if set up.
