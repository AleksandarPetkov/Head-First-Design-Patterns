**** What is a network?
 A network is a group of two or more computers (or devices) that are connected so they can share information, resources,
 or services (like printers, files, or internet access).

 👩‍💻🧑‍💻 Example: Computer A + Computer B
 When Computer A and Computer B are connected:

 ✅ They can send files to each other
 ✅ They can communicate (e.g., chat or send messages)
 ✅ They can share the internet or printers
 ✅ They can access shared folders or programs

🔌 How does it work?
 - Physical Connection
 - With a cable (Ethernet) or Wi-Fi
 - Both computers are connected to the same router or switch

  IP Address: Each computer gets a unique IP address (like a home address) It helps devices find each other on the network

**** Protocol (language)

 Computers use rules like TCP/IP to talk and transfer data safely

 📦 Example Scenario:
 You want to send a file from Computer A to Computer B

 A locates B using the IP address
 A sends the file using TCP/IP over the cable or Wi-Fi
 B receives and saves the file

**** What is a Gateway?
 A gateway is a device (usually a router) that connects your local network (like Computer A and Computer B) to another network, often the internet.
 Think of it like a bridge or a doorway between your small home network and the big world of the internet.

 🖥️💻 Example with Computer A and B + Gateway:
 Computer A and Computer B are connected to the same router
 The router also connects to the internet
 The router acts as the gateway

*** HTTPS / TCP/IP connection
 Example: when you connect to Google.com, the connection is made using HTTPS, which runs on top of TCP/IP.

 ➡️ So when you type https://www.google.com, your computer is using:
  🔹 IP to reach Google’s server
  🔹 TCP to open the connection
  🔹 TLS (inside HTTPS) to encrypt it
  🔹 HTTPS to actually request the web page

 🔐 So what is HTTPS? = HTTP + SSL/TLS
   HTTP: the protocol for web communication (e.g., requesting pages)
   TLS: encrypts everything so no one can spy on you
   Runs over TCP/IP
