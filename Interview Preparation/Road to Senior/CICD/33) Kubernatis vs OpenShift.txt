 OpenShift vs Kubernetes: Core Relationship
Feature         	Kubernetes	                                         OpenShift
What it is		Container orchestration engine	                         Enterprise platform built on top of Kubernetes
Developed by		Open-source (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) 	 Red Hat (now part of IBM)
Installation		DIY â€“ you install, configure, and secure it	         Pre-packaged, includes installer, UI, monitoring, CI/CD tools, etc.
User Interface		CLI-first (kubectl)	                                 Rich web console + CLI (oc)
Security		Up to the admin	                                         Enforces stricter defaults (e.g., SecurityContext, RBAC)
Built-in Tools		Minimal	Includes logging, monitoring, CI/CD (Tekton), developer tools

âœ… In short:
OpenShift uses Kubernetes under the hood.

It's like a ready-to-go, enterprise-friendly Kubernetes platform.

You still write Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.), but OpenShift may wrap or enhance them.

ðŸ§  Think of it like this:
Kubernetes = raw engine

OpenShift = engine + dashboard + guard rails + enterprise support
